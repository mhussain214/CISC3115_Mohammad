13.1 
Choice f is the correct option


13.3
a. An abstract class can be used just like a nonabstract class except that you cannot use the new operator to create an instance from the abstract class.
True.

b. An abstract class can be extended.
True. 

c. A subclass of a nonabstract superclass cannot be abstract.
False.

d. A subclass cannot override a concrete method in a superclass to define it as abstract.
True.

e. An abstract method must be nonstatic.
True. 

13.4 
The code compiles because the reference types are compatible (both Number), but it causes a runtime error (ClassCastException) 
because you are attempting an illegal cast from Integer to Double. 

13.5
Even though the array is declared as Number[], the actual runtime type of the array is Integer[], and you cannot store a Double in an array of Integer. 

13.6
OUTPUT -
3
3.0

13.7
The issue here is that the Number class does not have a compareTo method. 
To fix this issue, you can cast x to Integer before calling the compareTo method:
System.out.println(((Integer) x).compareTo(new Integer(4)));

13.8
The issue here is that the result of x.compareTo(new Integer(4)) is of type int, not Integer. Therefore, the cast to Integer is unnecessary and incorrect.
To fix this issue, you can directly print the result without the cast:
System.out.println(x.compareTo(new Integer(4)));

13.13: Can you create an instance using new A()?
No, you cannot create an instance of an interface using the new keyword. Interfaces in Java cannot be instantiated on their own. 
They are meant to be implemented by classes, and instances of those classes can be created.

13.14: Can you declare a reference variable x with type A like this?
Yes, you can declare a reference variable of type A:     A x;


13.15
The method print(); is missing a return type, and interfaces cannot have a body for methods. The correct syntax for an interface method is:
abstract interface A {
    void print();


13.16
The method m1() in the interface A should not have a body.
The method m1() in the class B should use the @Override annotation when implementing an interface method.
The System.out.println("ml"); statement is outside any method or block and should be placed inside a method.
interface A {
    void m1();
}

class B implements A {
    @Override
    public void m1() {
        System.out.println("ml");
    }
}


13.17
True. If a class implements the Comparable interface, it means that instances of that class can be compared with each other using the compareTo method. 


13.18
The correct method header for the compareTo method in the String class is:
public int compareTo(String o)

13.19
The code will not compile. The compareTo method is not defined in the Object class. 
Even though n1 is of type Integer and n2 is of type Object, the compiler checks the types at compile time. 

13.20
You can define the compareTo method in a class without implementing the Comparable interface. 


13.21
The Person class needs to implement the Comparable interface and provide an implementation for the compareTo method for proper sorting. 
Here's the corrected code:

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person[] persons = {new Person(3), new Person(4), new Person(1)};
        Arrays.sort(persons);
    }
}

class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
    private int id;

    Person(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Person other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.id, other.id);
    }
}

13.22
You cannot invoke the clone() method to clone an object if the class for the object does not implement the java.lang.Cloneable interface. 
This is because the clone() method is protected in java.lang.Object 

13.23
If the House class did not override the clone() method or if House did not implement java.lang.Cloneable, 
attempting to invoke the clone() method on a House object would result in a CloneNotSupportedException at runtime


13.24
OUTPUT
TRUE
FALSE
TRUE

13.25
output
true
false
list is [New York, Atlanta]
list1 is [New York, Atlanta]
list2.get(0) is New York
list2.size() is 1



13.26
You need to cast the result to GeometricObject. Additionally, you need to ensure that the GeometricObject class implements Cloneable. 
 corrected code:

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GeometricObject x = new Circle(3);
        GeometricObject y = (GeometricObject) x.clone();
        System.out.println(x == y);
    }
}


13.29
a. An interface is compiled into a separate bytecode file.

True. In Java, each interface is compiled into its own bytecode file with a .class extension.
b. An interface can have static methods.

True. Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have static methods. These methods are defined using the static keyword and can be invoked using the interface name.
c. An interface can extend one or more interfaces.

True. An interface in Java can extend one or more interfaces using the extends keyword.
d. An interface can extend an abstract class.

False. In Java, an interface cannot extend a class, whether it's abstract or not. An interface can only extend other interfaces.
e. An abstract class can extend an interface.

False. An abstract class in Java can implement an interface, but it cannot extend an interface. Abstract classes can extend other classes (abstract or concrete) or be standalone.
